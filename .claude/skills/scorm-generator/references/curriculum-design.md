# Curriculum Design Reference

## Backward Design Process (Understanding by Design)

### Stage 1: Identify Desired Results
- What should learners know and be able to do?
- What enduring understandings are desired?
- What essential questions will guide learning?

### Stage 2: Determine Assessment Evidence
- How will learners demonstrate understanding?
- What evidence will show they've achieved goals?
- What criteria define acceptable performance?

### Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences
- What activities will help learners achieve goals?
- What resources and materials are needed?
- How will learning be sequenced?

## Learning Path Design

### Linear Path
Best for: Foundational courses, compliance training
```
Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3 → Final
```

### Branching Path
Best for: Personalized learning, different roles
```
        ┌→ Path A (Beginners)
Module 1 ─┼→ Path B (Intermediate)
        └→ Path C (Advanced)
```

### Modular Path
Best for: Reference courses, just-in-time learning
```
Module 1 ←→ Module 2 ←→ Module 3
(Any order, learner choice)
```

## Content Chunking Guidelines

### Micro-learning (2-5 minutes)
- Single concept or skill
- Quick reference material
- Just-in-time support

### Standard Lesson (5-10 minutes)
- One learning objective
- Concept + example + practice
- Knowledge check included

### Extended Module (20-30 minutes)
- Multiple related objectives
- Deep dive content
- Substantial practice

## Scaffolding Techniques

1. **Modeling** - Show how it's done
2. **Guided practice** - Do it together
3. **Independent practice** - Do it alone
4. **Feedback** - Review and improve
5. **Application** - Use in real context
